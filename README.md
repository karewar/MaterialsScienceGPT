## 💬 Example Questions

You can ask questions like:
- *What are the best corrosion-resistant materials for marine environments (e.g., desalination)?*
- *Which materials are ideal for solar panel coatings and desert heat management?*
- *What materials are used for aerospace structures in extreme climates?*
- *What advanced materials are used in electric vehicles and batteries in the UAE?*
- *How can one leverage AI/ML techniques in Materials Science?*

The bot will respond with a structured comparison of the best material options along with their justifications.
